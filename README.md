# Talk-assisstant
This is a Talk Assisstant Program built in Python.
The program can play video on youtube and searches on google via voice commands.
For doing so however, the user must log in to the program by giving any on the special commands like (Hello Jarvis, Hey Jarvis, Okay Jarvis, Jarvis and so on..)
After logging in, if you don't want do anything then you can simply say "Thankyou" or "Thankou Jarvis" to close the program automatically with a nice message.

Python modules that I have used in this program are :
speech_recognition - for speech recognition
pyttsx3 - for talking back system
webbrowser - for google search
pywhatkit - for youtube search
